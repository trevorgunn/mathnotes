    <definition>
      <p>
        A <em>metric graph</em> <m>\Gamma</m> is a graph in the combinatorial sense
        (multiple edges and loops are allowed)
        but modelled as a metric space by giving each edge <m>e</m> a positive length
        <m>\ell(e) \in (0, \infty]</m>,
        possibly restricted to some subgroup like <m>\Q</m> or <m>\Z</m>.
        In this way, we make each edge isometric to the interval <m>[0,\ell(e)]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, we will ask that the only vertices we consider are the ones that are
        required topologically. I.e. the ones of degree different from 2 since two edges
        meeting at a single vertex can just be joined up and their lengths added.
        Vertices of degree 2 will come and go as needed.
        The last requirement is that only leaf edges are allowed to be infinite and conversely,
        every leaf edge is required
        to be infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call the underlying combinatorial graph <m>|\Gamma|</m>.

    <p>
      Mirroring <xref ref="def-weil-divisor" /> the from the previous section,
      we define divisors and a divisor group.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
        A <em>divisor</em> on <m>\Gamma</m> is a finitely-supported formal sum
        <me>
          D = \sum_{p \in \Gamma} a_p \cdot p
        </me>
        with <m>a_p \in \Z</m> and <m>p</m> from anywhere in <m>\Gamma</m>, not just the topological
        vertices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The set of all divisors is the group <m>\Div(\Gamma)</m> and the degree map is
        <m>\deg(\sum a_p \cdot p) = \sum a_p</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Like with algebraic curves, we also have a notion of principal divisors. These are
      given as the divisors of piecewise-linear functions.
      Really these are piecewise affine-functions, but like with algebraic curves, the
      "scalar multiple" doesn't matter so everyone just calls them "linear."
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next section, we will see why these are a natural choice and how they relate to
      rational functions on algebraic curves.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
        A function <m>f : \Gamma \to \R</m> is <em>piecewise linear</em>, if on each edge it is a
        continuous function that can be broken up into a finite set of linear functions.
        By abuse of terminology, we will also call these <em>rational functions</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The divisor of such an <m>f</m> is supported at the points <m>p</m> at which <m>f</m>
        is non-differentiable (including the topological vertices of <m>\Gamma</m>).
        We define <m>\ord_p(f)</m> to be the sum of the incoming slopes of <m>f</m> at <m>p</m>
        and define
        <me>
          \divisor(f) = \sum_{p \in \Gamma} \ord_p(f) \cdot p.
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        As in the previous section, we define <m>\Prin(\Gamma)</m> as the set of all principal divisors
        and define <m>\Jac(\Gamma) = \Div(\Gamma) / \Prin(\Gamma)</m> and
        <m>\Jac^0(\Gamma) = \Div^0(\Gamma)/\Prin(\Gamma)</m>.
        Like before, if <m>\Gamma</m> is compact, then every principal divisor has degree <m>0</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <p>
        If <m>|\Gamma|</m> is at tree, then any divisor on <m>\Gamma</m> is principal.
        Trees are the tropical analogue of <m>\A^1</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
        If <m>\Gamma</m> is a circle, then the rational functions on <m>\Gamma</m> look something like
        the following (absolute value of slopes indicated above)
      </p>

      <p>
        On a circle, the endpoints necessarily have the same <m>y</m>-coordinate.
        The divisor associated to this piecewise-linear function is
        <me>
          (- \tfrac12 + 0)a + (0 - 2)b + (2 + 1)c + (-1 + 0)d + (0 + \tfrac12)e
        </me>
      </p>
    </example>

    <remark>
      <title>Divisors on <m>G = |\Gamma|</m></title>
      <p>
        We also consider the simpler model of a multigraph (with no metric).
        Here the divisors are supported only on the vertices of <m>G</m>
        and the principal divisors are the image of the Laplacian operator
        <m>\Delta : V(G) \to \Div(G)</m> given by
      </p>
      <me>
        \Delta(v) = \sum_{w \sim v} (w - v) = \sum_{w \sim v} w - \val(v)
      </me>
      <p>
        (val = valence since we already have defined a "degree").
        It's not too important whether one takes <m>\Delta</m> or <m>-\Delta</m>.
        This definition agrees with the intersection theory we do in the next section.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p>
      Let's finish this section by elaboration on the difference between a <em>metric graph</em>
      and a <em>tropical curve</em>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-tropical-curve">
      <p>
        An <em>abstract tropical curve</em> or simply "tropical curve" is a metric graph <m>\Gamma</m>
        with non-negative weights at the vertices of <m>|\Gamma|</m>.
        Here we will also allow some vertices of degree 2 but require these to have a positive weight.
      </p>
    </definition>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="ss-classical-to-tropical-divisors">
    <title>From algebraic curves to tropical curves</title>

    <p>
      Let us begin by explaining where tropical curves come from in the first place.
      We will need the following notation going forward.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>
          <m>(K, v)</m>
        </title>
        <p>A field <m>K</m> with a non-trivial discrete valuation <m>v : R \to \Z</m></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>
          <m>(\O_K, \mathfrak m_K)</m>
        </title>
        <p>The ring of integers and maximal ideal of <m>K</m></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>
          <m>k</m>
        </title>
        <p>The residue field <m>k = \O_K/\mathfrak m_K</m> of <m>K</m></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>
          <m>\X</m>
        </title>
        <p>A curve over <m>\O_K</m> (relative dimension 1 scheme)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>
          <m>X</m>
        </title>
        <p>The general fibre <m>\mathfrak X_0</m><mdash/>a curve over <m>K</m></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>
          <m>\X_k</m>
        </title>
        <p>The special fibre<mdash/>a curve over <m>k</m></p>
      </li>
    </dl>

    <p>
      So here's the idea: we have some equation with coefficients in <m>\O_K</m> and that
      gives us two curves<mdash/>taking that equation mod <m>\mathfrak m_K</m> and viewing
      that equation in <m>K</m>.
      This gives us a degeneration of the curve <m>X</m> to the curve <m>\X_k</m>
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>An elliptic curve degenerating into a collection of rational curves</title>
      <p>
        Consider the integer equation
        <me>
          y^2 = x(x - 7)(x + 1).
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This defines a smooth elliptic curve in <m>\C</m> and if we consider this
        mod 7, we get a nodal cubic <m>y^2 = x^2(x + 1)</m>.
        See <xref ref="fig-elliptic-degeneration"/> for a picture
      </p>
    </example>

          </sageplot>
        </image>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We now explain how to generate a metric graph out of this.
      To that end, we would like for <m>\X_k</m> to have several singularities
      but only nodal singularities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>V_1, \dots, V_k</m> be the irreducible components of <m>\X_k</m>.
      Define a graph <m>G</m> with vertex set <m>v_1, \dots, v_k</m> and
      connect <m>v_i</m> to <m>v_j</m> if <m>V_i</m> and <m>V_j</m> intersect.
      We allow self-intersections and multiple intersections so <m>G</m>
      is a multi-graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gets us the underlying graph. To get the metric, we define the length of
      an edge <m>v_i v_j</m> to be <m>n</m> if at that point of intersection,
      the variety is described locally by <m>xy = f</m>
      where <m>f \in K</m> has valuation <m>n</m>.
      This could be non-integral.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example above, the metric graph would be a circle of length 1 since locally
      the equation is <m>xy = 7^1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The weight of a vertex <m>v_i</m> is the genus of <m>v_i</m>.
      We will not do much with these weights in this discussion other than to observe that
      they dictate what sort of intersections we allow if we compare with
      <xref ref="def-tropical-curve"/>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
        We call this metric curve defined above the <em>dual graph</em> of <m>\X_k</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A curve <m>\X</m> with the given notation is said to be a <em>semistable model</em>
        for <m>X</m> if if the dual graph of <m>\X_k</m> is a tropical curve (so an
        example requirement is that there are only nodal intersections).
      </p>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <p>
        Given a point of <m>X</m> we can consider its Zariski closure in <m>\X</m>
        and extending this process linearly, we have a way of taking a divisor on <m>X</m>
        and getting a divisor on <m>\X</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>V_1, \dots, V_k</m> are the components of <m>\X_k</m> as before, then we have
        an intersection pairing taking a divisor <m>\mathscr D</m> on <m>\X</m> to
        <me>
          \mathscr D \cdot V_i = \deg(\L(\mathscr D)|_{V_i}).
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting this altogether we get a homomorphism <m>\rho : \Div(X) \to \Div(G)</m>
        where
        <me>
          \rho(D) = \sum_{i = 1}^k (\mathscr D \cdot V_i) v_i.
        </me>
      </p>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Another way to describe this map is to take a point <m>P \in X(K) = \X(\O_K)</m>
      and then reduce mod <m>\mathfrak m_K</m> to get a point <m>p \in \X_k</m>.
      That point <m>p</m> belongs to one of the components <m>V_1,\dots,V_k</m>
      and that gives us a map from <m>X(K)</m> to the vertex set of <m>G</m>.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Since the map <m>X(K) \to \X_k</m> is surjective, the map
        <m>\rho : \Div(X) \to \Div(G)</m> is also surjective.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p>
      Doing a bit of intersection theory, we see that for <m>i \neq j</m>
      <me>V_i \cdot V_j = |V_i \cap V_j|</me>
      is the number of places components <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> intersect.
      Additionally, the self-intersection number is
      <me>V_i \cdot V_i = - \val(v_i)</me>
      where valence of a vertex is the number of neighbours.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason why this self-intersection number is what it is is because the
      total degree needs to be <m>0</m>.
      Many self-intersection problems are computed this way. For instance, in the plane,
      two lines intersect in a single point. So <m>\ell \cdot \ell = 1</m>.
      But now if we blow up the point of intersection, the class <m>\ell</m> becomes
      <m>\ell + E</m><mdash/>an exceptional divisor. And here we still have
      <m>(\ell + E)(\ell + E) = 1</m> except now <m>\ell</m> and <m>\ell</m>
      do not intersect but <m>\ell \cdot E = 1</m> and in order to make the equation
      come out right, <m>E \cdot E = -1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We point the reader to <xref ref="L"/> (Chapter 9) for further explanation.
      The takeaway here is that divisors supported on <m>\X_k</m>
      always map to principal divisors in <m>G</m>.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Now it's not true that elements of <m>\Prin(X)</m> remain principal in <m>\X</m>.
        However, as we have seen just above, the part of <m>\divisor(f)</m> which is
        supported on <m>\X_k</m> specializes to a principal divisor on <m>G</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if we start with a divisor <m>\divisor(f)</m> on <m>X</m> and take the closure
        in <m>\X</m>, the result differs from a principal divisor on <m>\X</m> by a divisor
        supported in <m>\X_k</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now two facts are true: first if <m>\mathscr D</m> is a principal divisor on <m>\X</m>
        then <m>\O(\mathscr D) \cong \O</m> so <m>\rho(\mathscr D) = 0</m> by definition.
        Second, if <m>D \in \Prin(X)</m> then <m>\rho(D)</m> differs from <m>\rho(\mathscr D) = 0</m>
        by <m>\rho(\mathscr D|_{\X_k}) \in \Prin(G)</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p>
      Let's summarize what we have so far.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <title>Specialization of divisors to graphs</title>
      <p>
        With the notation as before, there is a well defined map
        <me>\rho : \Div(X) \to \Div(G)</me>
        taking principal divisors to principal divisors.
      </p>
    </theorem>

    <remark>
      <p>
        There are three problems with all of this.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>We started with metric graphs but this whole last section was about non-metric graphs</li>
        <li>We have restricted ourselves to DVRs</li>
        <li>This construction is not functorial with respect to base change (next example)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All of this is fixed by looking at Berkovich spaces.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <example>
      <p>
        Let <m>K = \C((t))</m> and <m>\X</m> be the projective curve defined by <m>xy = tz^2</m>.
        This is a smooth conic which degenerates to the pair of lines <m>V : x = 0</m> and <m>W : y = 0</m>.
        So the dual graph consists of a single edge <m>v \sim w</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>D = P + Q</m> with
        <me>
          P = (\sqrt t : \sqrt t : 1) \text{ and } Q = (-\sqrt t : - \sqrt t : 1).
        </me>
        Then as <m>t \to \infty</m>, both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> converge to the node <m>(0:0:1)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the solutions to <m>x = y</m> in <m>\X</m> these are exactly <m>P + Q</m>
        and we also have a couple of poles at infinity <m>(1:0:0) + (0:1:0)</m>.
        Or in other words,
        <me>
          P + Q - (1:0:0) - (0:1:0) = \div(x - y)
        </me>
        So <m>P + Q \sim (1:0:0) + (0:1:0)</m> and consequentially <m>\rho(P + Q) = v + w</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, if we base change to <m>\C((t^{\frac12}))</m> then we have
        to blow up at <m>x = y = 0</m> to regularize and this adds a new component <m>U</m>
        to <m>\X'_k</m> sitting exactly halfway between <m>v</m> and <m>w</m>.
        Now <m>\rho(P + Q) = 2u</m>, and while this is linearly equivalent to <m>v + w</m>,
        the map <m>\rho</m> has changed on the level of <m>\Div(X)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that <m>x - y</m> vanishes along this exceptional divisor and both <m>P</m>
        and <m>Q</m> degenerate to <m>U</m>.

    <title>The Baker Specialization Lemma</title>

    <p>
      First we need a definition of <m>r(D) = \dim \L(D) - 1</m> that
      can be made sense of if <m>D</m> is a tropical divisor.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
        If <m>D</m> is a divisor (tropical or algebraic), then recall that
        <m>|D| = \{E \ge 0 : E \sim D\}</m>. We define <m>r(D) = -1</m> if
        <m>|D| = \varnothing</m> and otherwise
        <me>
          r(D) =           
            \max\{k : |D - E| \ne \varnothing, \text{ for all } E \in \Div_+^k(X)\}.
        </me>
        (<m>\Div_+^k(X) = </m> effective and degree <m>k</m>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This definition works the same if we replace <m>X</m> by <m>G</m> or <m>\Gamma</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-rank-comparison">
      <title>Relation to the previous definition</title>
      <p>The number <m>r(D)</m> we defined is equal to <m>\dim \L(D) - 1</m> for algebraic curves.</p>
      <proof>
        See e.g. <xref ref="B"/> Lemma 2.4.
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-rank-properties">
      <p>
        For every point <m>P</m>, we have <m>r(D - P) \ge r(D) - 1</m> and moreover there exists
        a point <m>P</m> for which <m>r(D - P) = r(D) - 1</m>.
      </p>
      <proof>
        <p>Let <m>r = r(D)</m>. If <m>r(D) \le 0</m> then this is evident.</p>
        <p>
          Now suppose <m>E = P_1 + P_2 + \dots + P_r</m> is any rank <m>k</m> divisor
          then <m>|D - P_1 - \dots - P_r| \neq \varnothing</m> by definition.
          It follows that <m>r(D - P_1) \ge r - 1</m> for any point <m>P_1</m> since
          <m>P_2, \dots, P_r</m> are arbitrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose <m>E = P_1 + \dots + P_r</m> is the divisor that achieves the maximum.
          Then <m>r(D - P_1) = r - 1</m> since otherwise we could do better than <m>E</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The proof of <xref ref="thm-rank-comparison"/> consists of showing the hypothesis
      for <xref ref="thm-rank-properties"/> and applying induction.
      We end with a proof of Baker's Lemma <xref ref="B"/>.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <title>Baker's Specialization Lemma</title>
      <p>
        We have <m>r_{G}(\rho(D)) \ge r_X(D)</m> for any divisor <m>D</m> on <m>X</m>.
      </p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>\bar D = \rho(D)</m>. We will show by induction that if
          <m>r_X(D) \ge r</m> then <m>r_G(\bar D) \ge r</m> as well.
          The base case, <m>r = -1</m> is clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose next <m>r = 0</m> and <m>r_X(D) \ge 0</m>.
          Then <m>|D| \neq \varnothing</m> so there exists an effective divisor
          <m>E \sim D</m>. Since <m>\rho</m> is a homomorphism, we have
          <m>\bar D = \rho(D) \sim \rho(E) \ge 0</m>
          and consequentially <m>r_G(\bar D) \ge 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose <m>r \ge 1</m>. Let <m>\bar P \in V(G)</m> be any vertex.
          Since <m>\rho</m> is surjective, we can find some <m>P \in X</m>
          with <m>\rho(P) = \bar P</m>.
          Now by <xref ref="thm-rank-properties"/>, <m>r_X(D - P) \ge r - 1</m>
          and by induction <m>r_G(\bar D - \bar P) \ge r - 1</m>.
          Since this holds for all <m>\bar P</m>, we conclude that <m>r_G(\bar D) \ge r</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

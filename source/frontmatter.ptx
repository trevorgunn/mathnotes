      Some collected notes, problems and examples in algebra and combinatorics.
      These notes come from comunicating to various audience: talks I have given,
      courses I have taught, other conversations. As such, they are a little bit all
      over the place in terms of level of background.
    </p>

    <p>
      At minimum, these notes require knowledge of linear algebra, calculus
      and combinatorics to appreciate fully.

      I would like to thank the professors and teachers at my <em>alma mater</em>,
      the University of Waterloo for teaching me mathematics and shaping my mathematical interests.
      There are too many to name, so I will instead give special mention to the two people who supervised
      my undergraduate research: David Jackson and Matthew Satriano (in different years).
    </p>

    <p>
      I would also like to thank the open source community for providing the tools on which these notes
      are produced. This includes, among others, the developers of <url href="https://pretextbook.org/" visual="PreTeXt" />,
      <url href="https://www.sagemath.org/" visual="Sagemath" />, <url href="https://www.mathjax.org/" visual="MathJax" />,
      <url href="https://www.latex-project.org/" visual="LaTeX" /> including AMS-<latex/>.

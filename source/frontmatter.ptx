    <p>
      Some collected notes, problems and examples in algebra and combinatorics.
      These notes come from comunicating to various audience: talks I have given,
      courses I have taught, other conversations. As such, they are a little bit all
      over the place in terms of level of background.
    </p>

    <p>
      At minimum, these notes require knowledge of linear algebra, calculus
      and combinatorics to appreciate fully.
